#summary How to start using beanmonitor
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Introduction =

The primary purpose of beanmonitor is to send emails whenever something is wrong with our user_beancounters. Usually, you need this feature if you are restricting resources (say, for security) but want to be able to increase them when you hit a limit. This is especially useful because an unnoticed resource problem can lead to lots of digging in the wrong direction.

Alternatively, you can simply use this script to simply see if any failcounts have increased since you last checked using beanmonitor. If this is your use case you can skip everything related to email.

= Basic startup testing =

Once installed, issueing `beanmonitor --help` should yield something like this:

<code>
Usage: /usr/local/bin/beanmonitor [options]

General options:
    -c, --config CONFIGFILE          Load CONFIGFILE instead of /etc/beanmonitor.conf
    -d, --[no-]debug                 Enable/disable debug mode (spam a lot of uninformative messages)
    -b, --beanfile FILENAME          Load current beancounter values from FILENAME
                                     instead of file specified in the config.
    -s, --savefile FILENAME          Save current values to FILENAME instead
                                     of what's specified in the config file
    -u, --[no-]update                Save current values to savefile to check for differences
                                     in the future
    -w, --[no-]write                 Whether or not to save command line config to config file.
                                     This does only overwrite values which
                                     you have specified as command line arguments here; it does
                                     not touch existing values in th config without a new value specified here.

Email mapping options: (use -w/--write or this is kind of worthless)
        --email-add UID:ADDRESS      Add an email address to be notified for a certain
                                     uid or for all uids if none is specified.
                                     This implies --write which can not be unset by --no-write!
        --email-del ADDRESS          Remove an email address from the list of recipients. Currently this
                                     removes all occurences; fix in the near future.
                                     This implies --write which can not be unset by --no-write!
        --email-list                 Dump recipients list in yaml.

Actions:
        --show                       Show differences between the last known version of user_beancounters and the current
                                     state of the aforementioned file. Outputs pure yaml if you care to use it in another ruby script.
        --email                      Sends emails about differences in failcount to all configured recipients.
</code>

If that's the case; continue. If not you need to properly install beanmonitor or file a report within the issue tracker.

= Configuration =

== Overview ==

There's no default configuration file but don't worry, it will use the default settings.

You don't need to edit any configuration as you can set anything on the command line using the pretty well documented command line options and just add -w to write it to the config file.

If `/etc/beanmonitor.conf` doesn't suit you, you can add -c and tell beanmonitor where to put config data but remember to supply -c each and any time you use beanmonitor as it can't save the config file path anywhere (which is pretty obvious, if you think about it).

For starters, without doing anything, you should be able to just issue

<code>
beanmonitor --show
</code>

This should output nothing - at least if no failcount has increased since the last time you called it.

If that's the case it will output the uid of the vps for which a failcount increase has happened and all counters that were affected, like this, for example:

<code>
# beanmonitor --no-update --show 
--- 
201: 
  privvmpages: 60
</code>

The output format is yaml and pretty self explanatory.

== Detailed configuration ==

Say you want to change the path for the savefile, the file where the last status of all beancounters is stored:

<code>
beanmonitor --savefile /tmp/savefile -w
</code>

If you don't add `-w` or `--write` to the argument list, your changes will only last for one execution of beanmonitor. This is useful if you, for example, run beanmonitor from another script without any config file whatsoever.

You can save any changed command line option to the config file using this syntax except for `--write`, `-w`, `--update`, `-u` and `--config`, `-c` because those don't make too much sense in a config file.

== Email setup ==

Let's pretend that you have two vps with uids 200 and 201. John administrates vps 201 but is a rookie, so you as the host server's administrator want to get failcounter messages for his vps as well. Try this:

<code>
beanmonitor --email-add 201:john@hisdomain.com
beanmonitor --email-add you@yourdomain.com
beanmonitor --email-list
</code>

What this does is add `john@hosdomain.com` as a recipient for all failcounter increases for vps 201 and `you@yourdomain.com` for failcounter increases on the entire openvz enabled machine. So when a counter for 201 increases, both you and john are notified whereas when a counter for 200 increases, you are the only one who is notified.

You don't need to specify the `--write` switch for `--email-*` operations, because they imply it as they don't make much sense without it.

You can try sending emails by artificially decreasing a counter in your `savefile` and running `beanmonitor --email`.

== Adding it to cron ==

In order to make beanmonitor really useful, it needs to be checked on a regular basis, to do that we'll be using cron:

Edit the cron into the interactive editor:
<code>
crontab -e
</code>

Add this line:
<code>
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/beanmonitor --email
</code>

This will run beanmonitor every 5 minutes sending emails whenever a change is detected.

Alternatively, you can do this all from commandline by doing:

<code>
crontab -l > $USER+$HOSTNAME.cron && echo '*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/beanmonitor --email' >> $USER+$HOSTNAME.cron && crontab $USER+$HOSTNAME.cron
</code>

This will export the crontab list to a unique file name, add the line to that file, then import the list back into crontab.
