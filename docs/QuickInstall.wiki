#summary Quickly installing beanmonitor
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Steps =

=== Install ruby (do one of the following as root or using sudo) ===
  * Gentoo: `emerge ruby`
  * Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install ruby`
  * Fedora/Redhat: `yum install ruby ruby-libs ruby-mode ruby-rdoc ruby-irb ruby-ri ruby-docs`

Most of these commands were stolen from google so no guarantees. 


=== Install beanmonitor ===
Simply run the following command as root / use sudo:

{{{
wget http://beanmonitor.googlecode.com/files/beanmonitor-singlesource.tar.bz2 ; tar jxf beanmonitor-singlesource.tar.bz2 ; \
rm LICENSE ; cp beanmonitor /usr/local/bin ; rm beanmonitor ; rm beanmonitor-singlesource.tar.bz2
}}}

This is kinda hackish but we are in the *quick install* guide here.
